**CPython** is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the Python language.

**CPython** can be defined as both an interpreter and a compiler as it compiles Python code into bytecode before interpreting it. It has a foreign function interface with several languages, including C, in which one must explicitly write bindings in a language other than Python.
