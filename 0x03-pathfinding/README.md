#### Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#### General
- What is pathfinding
- What are the most common applications of pathfinding
- What is backtracking, and why you should never use it
- What is Dijkstra’s algorithm, and what is its main weakness
- What is A star algorithm, and how it is better than Dijkstra’s
